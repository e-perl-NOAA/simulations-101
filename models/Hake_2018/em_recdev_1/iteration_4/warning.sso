Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : Minimum pop size bin:_10; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 5
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 3 : Final gradient: 289.382 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
Note 2 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
