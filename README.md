# simulations-101
Running simulations on the test models using a workflow similar to that of ss3sim.

Locally I have a folder called "models" in this directory where I have downloaded the models in the nmfs-stock-synthesis/test-files models. 
However, to keep the number of changes to commit while testing this workflow small (just committing changes to the R code), those models
are not included in this repository.

This workflow is also written for the use case of trying a 64-core Windows machine using my access to a Microsoft Azure VM. This workflow will
likely be much slower on a machine with less cores.
